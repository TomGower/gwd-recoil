# gwd-recoil
A re-factor of my scoresheet for playing Geeks Who Drink-style pub quiz games
as a tool to learn the new React state management tool Recoil.

The original is deployed at https://nameless-stream-40581.herokuapp.com/
Code for the original is available at https://github.com/TomGower/gwd-scoresheet

To run locally, npm install, npm run build-dev, and npm run start-dev, then
localhost:2017.

Known issues: https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/issues/12
Possible other issues: TBD, only modest checking of other potential issues. Use the deployed
original if you want something known to be good.
